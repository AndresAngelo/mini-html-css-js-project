        Nobody knows, just why we're here.
        Could it be fate or random circumstance?
        At the right place, at the right time,
        two roads intertwine.
        And if the universe conspired,
        to meld our lives, to make us, fuel and fire,
        then know wherever you will be,
        So too, shall I'll be.
        Close your eyes, dry your tears
        'cause when nothing seems clear,
        you'll be safe here from the sheer weight
        of your doubts and fears,
        weary heart, you'll be safe here.
        Remember how we laughed until we cried?
        At the most stupid things like
        we were so high
        But love was all that we were on, we belong.
        And though the world would never understand.
        This unlikely union and why it still stands
        Someday, we will be set free,
        pray and believe.
        When the light disappears,

        You'll be safe here.
        Save your eyes from your tears,
        when everything's unclear,
        you'll be safe here from the sheer weight

        In my arms through the long cold night
        sleep tight, you'll be safe here.
        When no one understands,
        I'll believe, you'll be safe,
        You'll be safe, you'll be safe here.
        Put your heart in my hands,

        But love was all that we were on, we belong.
        And though the world would never understand.
        This unlikely union and why it still stands
        Someday, we will be set free,
        pray and believe.
        When the light disappears,
        and when this world's insincere
        You'll be safe here,
        when nobody hears you scream,
        I'll scream with you.
        You'll be safe here.
        Save your eyes from your tears,
        when everything's unclear,
        you'll be safe here from the sheer weight
        of your doubts and fears, wounded heart.
        When the light disappears
        And when this world's insincere
        You'll be safe here,
        when nobody hears you scream,
        I'll scream with you. You'll be safe here.
        In my arms through the long cold night
        sleep tight, you'll be safe here.
        When no one understands,
        I'll believe, you'll be safe,
        You'll be safe, you'll be safe here.
        <strong> Put your heart in my hands,
        You'll be safe here.</strong>
        Nobody knows, just why we're here.
        Could it be fate or random circumstance?
        At the right place, at the right time,
        two roads intertwine.
        And if the universe conspired,
        to meld our lives, to make us, fuel and fire,
        then know wherever you will be,
        So too, shall I'll be.
        Close your eyes, dry your tears
        'cause when nothing seems clear,
        you'll be safe here from the sheer weight
        of your doubts and fears,
        weary heart, you'll be safe here.
        Remember how we laughed until we cried?
        At the most stupid things like
        we were so high
        But love was all that we were on, we belong.
        And though the world would never understand.
        This unlikely union and why it still stands
